This is the Gumball2D Demo!
Made by: Jordan Anderson, Isaac Mortenson, Jessica Nelle, Micah Penny, and Clayton Rueck.

Goal:
The object of the game is to destroy all the alien nests before they reach the portal. You are equipped with a gumball machine that has been modified to fire gumballs! Stick the aliens and prevent them from reaching earth. 

Controls:
Mouse - Aim
Left Click - Fire
AD - Move left and right
Space - Jump
E - Interact
ESC - Pause

How To:
You can destroy the nests by going up to them and pressing the interact button. This will place a drill on the nest that will eventually destroy the nest. You only have one drill, though, so you can only drill one at a time. There are three bars at the bottom of your screen. The first one is the portal's health, the second is a powerup timer, and the third is a jam meter; if the portal health reaches zero it's game over! Powerups can be purchased from the upgrade station if you have enough coins. Coins can be collected after you destroy a nest. The jam meter represents how much you can fire before your gumball machine gets jammed. Don't let it fill! That's about it; you are ready to stick some aliens!
